LeetCode
========

Let's begin with some problems from [Leet Code](www.leetcode.com).
Code it in whatever language you want, I myself will use Ruby so I can keep practicing.
The idea is threefold:

1. Learn from other's creativity on how to solve the problem
2. Learn from other's code in terms of:
   - writing style (naming, abstraction design, etc).
   - efficiency of the solutions (speed, memory).

To share code I am following a great idea from the Seattle.rb study group. So feel free to create a directory for your account name and submit any code. Please make sure to follow Ryan's James Brown Guide to git etiquette:

    [alias]
    down = pull --rebase
    onup = push

Now you too can join the James Brown school of git:

    git down && git onup

Schedule
========

This is tentative. Each one is free to follow his own path, on my part I am going to do the following in order. Probably one a day (no idea if they are too easy or not) up to Dec 13, and then more each day until Xmass.
